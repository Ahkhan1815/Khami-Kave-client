# Khami's Cave - Game Review Platform (Client Folder)

Link: https://khami-kave-client.onrender.com/

Overview: Khami's Kave is a simple game review platform where users can create accounts, post game reviews, and comment on each other's posts. The app is hosted on Render.

Purpose: This was my first full-stack project so the learning goals were centered around understanding REST APIs. The development process also taught me about the security principles behind handling user logins (ie. new accounts have to be verfied via email to post). Hosting this app on render also introduced me to CI/CD pipelines and log monitoring as Render's resources implement these tools.

# Features:
```
Account verification via Nodemailer
Comment on other's game reviews
Mobile-friendly responsive UI
Deployed on the cloud (Render)
```

# Tech Stack:
```
Frontend: React, Bootstrap
Backend: Node.js (Express)
Database: PostgreSQL
Deployment: Render
```

# What I Learned:
```
Frontend-Backend communication via REST APIS
Website styling with Bootstrap
Relational database models (Users-posts)
Hosting apps via services like Render
```

# Future Plans

As of now this project is finished. It served it's purpose as my entry into full-stack development. This project has a lot of room to improve, especially because I've learned a lot since its release.

```
Features I would add:
Genre tags so users can get analytics about their playing habits
AI game reccomendations based on liked games
Pull game titles from a database to allow for grouped game reviews
Voting system for game reviews
```
